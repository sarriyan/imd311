In addition, we also continue our studies at the same high school. I hope that our
relationship will last even though we rarely see each other because each of us has 
a career and some are continuing their studies.Hopefully our relationship will 
remain good even if we don't see each other.There is also a good friend of mine
 who passed away when we were in the fifth grade, hopefully things will be easier
 for the deceased there. I miss her so much. I also put a picture of the deceased
 here as a memory.</b><i></p>

<p align="justify" text align="left"><b><i>Nur Adilah, a lifelong friend since primary school, remains
 a constant source of support and someone with whom I share all aspects of my life. Our deep 
connection is rooted in years of shared experiences. In contrast, Nur Aina, a more recent friend from 
university, brings a dynamic focus on academic collaboration, particularly in working on assignments
 together. The combination of Nur Adilah's enduring emotional support and Nur Aina's more recent but 
impactful role in academic endeavors creates a well-rounded and fulfilling support system in my life.

<h2 font align="right"><b><i>University Friends</i></b></h2>
<p align="justify" text align="left"><b><i>University friends are really important to me.
 We go through classes and assignments together, supporting each other in tough times 
and celebrating our successes. What makes these friendships special is that we come from 
different backgrounds, and being with them has helped me see things from new perspectives.
 Whether we're working on projects, studying late, or just having fun during breaks, these 
friendships have made my time in university memorable and have given me a group of people
 who've been a big part of my college experience.
